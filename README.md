# docker-tor-exit-relay

Docker container for [Tor Exit Relay][3]

"Tor is free software and an open network that helps you defend against traffic analysis, a form of network surveillance that threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and relationships, and state security."

## Install dependencies

  - [Docker][2]

To install docker in Ubuntu 14.04 use the commands:

    $ sudo apt-get update
    $ sudo apt-get install docker.io

 To install docker in other operating systems check [docker online documentation][4]

## Usage

To run container use the command below:

    $ docker run -d -p 22 -p 9050:9050 -p 9001:9001 quantumobject/docker-tor-exit-relay

This container will generate dsa key for ssh the first time it is run , you need to add the private key to your  ~/.ssh/id_dsa to be able to ssh this container. You be able to check this dsa key with command :

    $ docker logs container-id

To access it and configured and used the container :

    $ docker exec -it container-id /bin/bash

Them you can use it by usewithtor command

    $ usewithtor ssh destination
  
To use ssh anonymous please read about limitation and security at [www.torproject.org][1]

You can create a new container everytime you need to use it and remove it when done with it but this is bad idea if you want to keep a stable exit relay. 

I added the  Reduced Exit Policy to the configuration to make sure to drastically reduces the odds that a bittorrent user will select your node and it will reduce the risk of getting DMCA takedowns.

Note: because you use it don't mean you are complete anonymous , please read about Tor at [www.torproject.org][1] before using it. This suppose to work like relay and it will use 50k/100k of your network bandwith.
